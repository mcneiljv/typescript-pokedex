# TypeScript Pok√©dex App

To run, just open the `index.html` file in the browser! If you edit the `app.ts` file to pull in different data, make sure you have [TypeScript](https://www.npmjs.com/package/typescript) installed globally on your machine. Then you can run `tsc` in the `typescript-pokedex` directory to compile your changes to vanilla JavaScript.
